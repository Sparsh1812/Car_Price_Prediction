Background |

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project aims to contribute to early diagnosis through the application of machine learning techniques on relevant patient data.

### Features:
**Classification Algorithms:** Utilized logistic regression, support vector machines, decision 
trees, random forest, na√Øve bayes and k-neighbors for predictive modeling.

**Feature Selection:** Implemented feature selection techniques to identify key factors contributing to Parkinson's disease.
**Model Interpretability:** Emphasized interpretability for clear insights into the factors influencing disease detection.
